Scripts:

Datawrang.py - Does the initial data cleaning and subsetting to get only sites with avian abundance data. Removes sites with missing data/too few data.

Modelbuild.py - Calculates diversity metrics, geographic weighting, land-use intensity scores, and country GDP for they year of study.

Modelplot.R - Fits linear mixed models to the data. Test impacts of weighting by geographic realm and feasibility of including habitat area. Fits models to all combination of potential factors, and then calculates the AIC values to determine the best model. 

run_miniproj.sh - Runs all the parts of the workflow to make the project reproducible.
