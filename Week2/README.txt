This directory contains python scripts used to learn the basics of the python 3 language, as well as example data used to run those scripts.

Python Version used: 3.5.2

Sub-Directories:

Code:	 	All code
Data:		All files to be used as inputs for scripts
Output:		Where any files generated by scripts will be placed
Sandbox: 	Misc files and outputs used while learning and experimenting


Scripts:

align_seqs.py - Compares the DNA base sequences contained within a specified csv file and finds the position at which they most closely match

align_seqs_better.py - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

align_seqs_fasta.py - Compares two DNA base sequences from two input files and finds the position at which they most closely match

basic_csv.py - Demonstates the usage of the csv library to read, manipulate and write to csv files

basic_io.py - Several blocks of script demonsrating the ways to input and output data from files into python, or to files out of python

boilerplate.py - Placeholder script for correctly formatting modules in a pythonic fashion

cfexercises1.py - Exercises detailing the usage of control statements and control flow

cfexercises2.py - Additional exercises detailing the usage of control statements and control flow

control_flow.py - Some functions exemplifying the use of control statements

debugme.py - A script with inbuilt bugs to demonstrate debugging practices

dictionary.py - Creates a dictionary of species' latin names sorted by Order

lc1.py - Creates lists of one attribute for several bird species in one tuple

lc2.py - Creates lists of both months in 1910 where rainfall was less than 50mm and month, rainfall tuples where rainfall exceeded 100mm. This is done via both loops and list comprehensions

loops.py - Some functions exemplifying the use of loops statements

oaks.py - Finds just those species that are oaks from a list of species' latin names

oaks_debugme.py - Module that checks a list of latin names to see which are oaks, and exports all oak species to a text file. Contains docstrings for debugging

scope.py - A script exemplifyig the theory of variable scope by using local and global variables in various ways

sysargv.py - A script exemplifing the use of sys.arg and how it behaves

test_control_flow.py - Some functions exemplifying the use of control statements with embedded docscripts for debugging

tuple.py - Prints the latin name, common name and mass of various bird species

using_name.py - Shows how to distinguish between the module being run directly or called from another module
