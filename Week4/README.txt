This contains work from week 4 of the CMEE course, i.e. basic stats work in R.

R Version used: 3.2.3

Subdirectories:
	Code - where all R code is stored
	Data - where data files are stored
	Output - any outputs are placed here
	Lectures18 - all lecture notes, powerpoint files and handouts
	Sandbox - Where any exploratory script is placed

------------------

No code in "code" directory as all code was snippits. Therefore they were placed into sandbox as there were no standalone working scripts.
