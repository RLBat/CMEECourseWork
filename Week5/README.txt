This directory contains any code and data from the GIS week of the CMEE course. Any large data files/QGIS files will not be version controlled and therefore not in this directory. As all files were large, this directory will be empty save for the organisational sub-directories.

Sub-Directories:

Code:	 	All code
Data:		All files to be used as inputs for scripts
Output:		Where any files generated by scripts will be placed
Sandbox: 	Misc files and outputs used while learning and experimenting
