This directory contains Python scripts used to broaden python skills, namely in modelling systems, constructing networks, profiling, subroutines and regular expressions.

Python Version used: 3.5.2

Required packages:
	- scipy
	- networkx
	- matplotlib
	- re
	- sys
	
R Version used: 3.2.3



Sub-Directories:

Code:	 	All code
Data:		All files to be used as inputs for scripts
Output:		Where any files generated by scripts will be placed
Sandbox: 	Misc files and outputs used while learning and experimenting

Scripts:

blackbirds.py - Uses regular expressions to search a text file and extracts the kingdom, phylum and species data 

DrawFW.py - Generates an food web with random body masses and associations then plots a network map using networkx

fmr.R - Plots log(field metabolic rate) against log(body mass) for the Nagy et al 1999 dataset to a file fmr.pdf. Used to demonstrate uses of the Python subprocess module

LV1.py - Constructs a Lotka-Volterra Model given default inputs, and produces graphs of both species over time and both species in relation to each other

LV2.py - Constructs a Lotka-Volterra Model given user inputs, and produces graphs of both species over time and both species in relation to each other

MyFirstJupyterNb.ipynb - 

Nets.R - 

profileme.py - An example script to show profiling optimisations (pre-optimisation)

profileme2.py - An example script to show profiling optimisations (optimised)

regexs.py - Uses a series of example regex expressions to teach regular expressions

run_fmr_R.py - Uses subprocess to run fmr.R via python and export the outputs to the Output subdirectory

run_LV.py - Runs scripts detailing various versions of Lotka-Volterra models with required user inputs

TestR.py - Example use of subprocess to run an R script and capture the output 

TestR.R - A Test file for using to show example use of subprocess in Python

timeitme.py - Uses the timeit command to compare optimised functions with non-optimised functions, compares to using time

using_os.py - Uses subprocess and regular expressions to find files/directories named in certain ways
