# replace \t's and \n's with a spaces:
text = text.replace('\t',' ')
text = text.replace('\n',' ')
# You may want to make other changes to the text. 

# In particular, note that there are "strange characters" (these are accents and
# non-ascii symbols) because we don't care for them, first transform to ASCII:

text = text.encode('ascii', 'ignore') # first encode into ascii bytes
text = text.decode('ascii', 'ignore') # Now decode back to string

# Regular expression that finds each instance of Kingdom name, Phylum name, and Species name
match = re.findall(r"Kingdom\s+([A-Z]\w+)\s.*?Phylum\s+([A-Z]\w+)\s.*?Species\s+([A-Z]\w+\s\w+)\s", text)

#Defines a header row
header = "Kingdom Phylum Species"

# Prints the found taxanomic data with headers
print(header + "\n" + "\n".join([" ".join(x) for x in match]))
