This section includes basic piped code and shell scripts used to learn the linux environment and basic bash commands. It also contains example data and outputs for use with the code.

Scripts:

UnixPrac1.txt - contains various piped commands that look at sequence data and recall various counts from it.

Shell Scrips:

Boilerplate.sh - Basic boilerplate file that simply prints "This is a shell script!"

CompileLaTeX.sh - Allows a LaTeX script (minus the .tex extension) to be converted to a PDF and a bibtex file of the same name to be added as a bibliography to the document.

ConcatenateTwoFiles - Copies the data from two input files into a singular specified output file, one after the other.

CountLines.sh - Counts the number of lines in a text file

csvtospace.sh - Converts a comma delimited file into a space delimited file and places the output into a new file (this does not alter the original file).

MyExampleScript.sh - Showcases the ability to use variables or manually input text for printed statements.

tabtocsv.sh - Converts a tab delimited file into a comma delimited file and places the output into a new file (this does not alter the original file).

tiff2png.sh - Converts a tiff file to a png CHECK
