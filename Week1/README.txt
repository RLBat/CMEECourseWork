Bash Version used: 4.3.48(1)

LaTeX Version used: TeX Live 2015

Sub-Directories:

Code:	 	All code (including LaTeX and Bibtex code)
Data:		All files to be used as inputs for scripts
Output:		Where any files generated by scripts will be placed
Sandbox: 	Misc files and outputs used while learning and experimenting


Scripts:

UnixPrac1.txt - contains various piped commands that look at sequence data and recall various counts from it.

Shell Scripts:

Boilerplate.sh - Basic boilerplate file that can be used as a template for other files

CompileLaTeX.sh - Allows a LaTeX script (minus the .tex extension) to be converted to a PDF and a bibtex file of the same name to be added as a bibliography to the document.

ConcatenateTwoFiles - Copies the data from two input files into a singular specified output file, one after the other.

CountLines.sh - Counts the number of lines in a text file

csvtospace.sh - Converts a comma delimited file into a space delimited file and places the output into a new file (this does not alter the original file).

MyExampleScript.sh - Showcases the ability to use variables or manually input text for printed statements.

tabtocsv.sh - Converts a tab delimited file into a comma delimited file and places the output into a new file (this does not alter the original file).

tiff2png.sh - Creates .png versions of any .tif file in the Data directory and places them in the output directory

variables.sh - Uses user inputs to demonstrate the usability of variables.
