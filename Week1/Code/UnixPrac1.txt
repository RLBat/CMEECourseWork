#1 
	#Prints the line counts for each of the 3 FASTA files
wc -l ../Data/407228326.fasta ../Data/407228412.fasta ../Data/E.coli.fasta 

#######

#2 	
	#Prints the file E.coli.fasta except the header line
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta

######

#3 
	#Prints the sequence length of the E.coli genome by counting the characters in the file
	#Header line and newline characters are removed prior to counting
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | wc -m

#######

#4 
	#Removes the header line and places the sequence data onto one line. 
	#Then searches for instances of the squence "ATGC", places each instance onto a new line
	#it then counts the number of lines to give a count of the instances.
tail -n +2 ../Data/E.coli.fasta | tr -d '\n' | grep -o "ATGC" | wc -l

#######

#5 Gives the ratio of AT to GC in the E.coli Genome
	#For each of A/T and G/C first the header line and newline characters are removed
	#Then the instances of each character are counted as in #4
	#The number of bases are divided to give a ratio, using bc -l to allow non-integer division
	#Echo is used to print the ratio
