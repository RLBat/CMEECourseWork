This directory contains R scripts used to learn the basics of the R language, as well as example data used to run those scripts.

R Version used: 3.2.3

Sub-Directories:

Code:	 	All code
Data:		All files to be used as inputs for scripts
Output:		Where any files generated by scripts will be placed
Sandbox: 	Misc files and outputs used while learning and experimenting

Scripts:

apply1.R - Script to show example usage of apply

apply2.R - Script to show more examples of apply usage

basic_io.R - A simple script to illustrate R input-output.

boilerplate.R - A boilerplate R script

break.R - Simple code to demonstrate the use of break within while loops

browse.R - Demonstrates the use of browse() 

control.R - Some code exemlifying control flow constructs in R

DataWrang.R - Using base R functions to wrangle a dataset from wide to long format

DataWrangTidy.R - Wrangles a badly formatted dataset into a long format with correct datatypes using Tidyr and Dplyr

get_TreeHeight.R - This function calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top, using  the trigonometric formula 

get_TreeHeight.py - TO BE ADDED

Girko.R - Generates a girko plot of random data using ggplots

Mapping.R - Loads a set of location data for various species, and plots these coordinates on a world map

MyBars.R - Creates a bar plot using ggplots

next.R - Simple code to demonstrate the use of next in loops

plotLin.R - Plots a scatterplot of random numbers and adds a regression line using ggplots

PP_Lattice.R - Generates density plots and key descriptive stats for predator/prey masses per type of feeding interaction. Outputs the results as a pdf for the graphs and a csv file of descriptive stats

PP_Regress.R - Plots predator mass against prey mass for each feeding interaction type, and gives lm estimates for each lifestage. Calculates true lm values for each lifestage, for each feeding interaction and outputs to a csv.

preallocate.R - Script demonstarting the speed benefits of pre-allocating variables

run_get_TreeHeight.sh - Runs get_TreeHeight.sh

sample.R - Runs a simulation that involves sampling from a population

TAutoCorr.R - Looks at the correlation between temperatures in FLorida in subsequent years. Compares these correlations to those between non-sequential years to determine how independant they are. 

TreeHeight.R - This function calculates heights of trees given distance of each tree from its base and angle to its top, using  the trigonometric formula 

try.R - Demonstrates usage of the try function

Vectorise.sh - IN PROGRESS - Compares R and Python run times for two scripts

Vectorise1.R - Shows the speed differences between using loops in R and pre-defined functions that call from C

Vectorize2.R - Runs the stochastic (with gaussian fluctuations) Ricker Eqn .
